•	JSR 338 Specification for persisting, reading and managing data from Java objects
•	Does not contain concrete implementation of the specification
•	Hibernate is one of the implementation of JPA

Hibernate

•	ORM Tool that implements JPA

Spring Data JPA

•	Does not have JPA implementation, but reduces boiler plate code
•	This is another level of abstraction over JPA implementation provider like Hibernate
•	Manages transactions

| API                  | Implementation of JPA                         | Wrapper over JPA (uses Hibernate under the hood by default) |
| Boilerplate Code     | Requires `SessionFactory`, transactions, etc. | Auto-manages repositories, transactions, and sessions       |
| Repository           | You write methods for CRUD                    | Comes with `JpaRepository` for CRUD and queries             |
| Transaction Handling | Manual (you manage begin/commit/rollback)     | Automatic with `@Transactional`                             |
